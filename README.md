## How It Works

1. **Export from Workday**: Students export their enrolled courses from UBC's Workday system as an Excel (.xlsx) file
2. **Upload & Parse**: The application reads the Excel file and extracts course information including:
   - Course names and codes
   - Meeting patterns (days and times)
   - Date ranges
   - Alternate week patterns
3. **Generate Calendar**: Creates individual calendar events for each class session throughout the semester
4. **Download**: User receives a `.ics` file that can be imported into any calendar application
